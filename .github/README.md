## üîß Implementation

### Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Require pull request reviews before merging
2. Require status checks (CI build/test) to pass
3. Dismiss stale approvals on new commits
4. Enforce linear history (no merge commits)

### Labels for Effective Triage
- **Type**: bug, feature, chore, docs, test
- **Area**: auth, db, grades, infra, ci, reports
- **Priority**: P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
- **Size**: S (small), M (medium), L (large)

See `REPOSITORY_CONFIGURATION.md` for detailed setup instructions and CLI commands.

## üìã Usage

1. **Creating Issues**: Choose from Bug Report, Feature Request, or Chore templates
2. **Opening PRs**: Fill out the pull request template checklist
3. **Code Review**: All changes require approval from code owners
4. **Project Tracking**: Issues automatically appear in the Backend Roadmap board

## üîí Security
